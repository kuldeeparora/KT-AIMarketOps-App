## 🏗️ **Unified Architecture**

### **🧠 Unified AI/AGI System** (`packages/ai-insights/src/unified-ai-system.ts`)

```typescript
export class UnifiedAISystem {
  // Enhanced AI with AGI Consciousness
  async enhancedAIResponse(query, context)
  
  // Enhanced Business Intelligence  
  async enhancedBusinessAnalysis(scenario)
  
  // Self-Improving System
  async continuousImprovement()
  
  // Unified Decision Making
  async unifiedDecisionMaking(context)
  
  // Unified Monitoring
  async getUnifiedStatus()
  
  // Adaptive Learning
  async adaptiveLearning(experience)
  
  // Creative Problem Solving
  async creativeProblemSolving(problem, constraints)
}
```

## 📋 **Migration Strategy**

### **Phase 1: Integration (Week 1)**
```typescript
// Replace separate AI/AGI calls with unified system
const unifiedAI = new UnifiedAISystem();

// Enhanced AI responses with consciousness
const response = await unifiedAI.enhancedAIResponse(query, context);

// Enhanced business analysis
const analysis = await unifiedAI.enhancedBusinessAnalysis(scenario);

// Unified decision making
const decision = await unifiedAI.unifiedDecisionMaking(context);
```

### **Phase 2: Enhancement (Week 2)**
```typescript
// Self-improving capabilities
const improvements = await unifiedAI.continuousImprovement();

// Adaptive learning
const learning = await unifiedAI.adaptiveLearning(experience);

// Creative problem solving
const solution = await unifiedAI.creativeProblemSolving(problem, constraints);
```

### **Phase 3: Optimization (Week 3)**
```typescript
// Unified monitoring
const status = await unifiedAI.getUnifiedStatus();

// Performance optimization
const performance = status.unified.performance;
const health = status.unified.overallHealth;
```

## 🔄 **Migration Steps**

### **Step 1: Update API Endpoints**
```typescript
// OLD: Separate AI and AGI endpoints
POST /api/ai/chat
POST /api/ai/agi-test

// NEW: Unified endpoints

<AIAssistant />
<AGIDashboard />

// NEW: Unified component
<UnifiedAIDashboard />
```

### **Step 3: Update Testing**
```bash
# OLD: Separate tests
npm run test:ai-complete
npm run test:agi-complete

# NEW: Unified tests
npm run test:unified-ai-complete
```
