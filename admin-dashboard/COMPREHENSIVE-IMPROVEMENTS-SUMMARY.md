# Alert Thresholds Implementation Plan (Inventory System)

---

## 1. Core Requirements

- Admins can define alert thresholds (e.g., “Low Stock” = less than 5 units) for products or groups of products.
- Flexible rules: Per-product, per-category, or global.
- Filters: Only include items with “Track quantity” enabled, or other custom filters.
- Notification: Email (and optionally Slack) when threshold is crossed.
- Frequency: Scheduled (e.g., daily at 6pm) or instant.
- UI: Multi-step wizard for creating/editing alerts, with preview of affected items.

---

## 2. Architecture Overview

### Frontend (React/Next.js, MUI)
- **AlertThresholdsWizard**: Multi-step wizard for creating/editing alert rules.
- **AlertThresholdsList**: List of all active thresholds, with edit/delete.
- **AlertNotificationSettings**: Configure email/Slack notifications.
- **InventoryTable**: Show which items are affected by each threshold.

### Backend (Next.js API routes, TypeScript)
- **API Endpoints:**
  - `GET /api/alert-thresholds` — List all thresholds
  - `POST /api/alert-thresholds` — Create new threshold
  - `PUT /api/alert-thresholds/:id` — Update threshold
  - `DELETE /api/alert-thresholds/:id` — Delete threshold
  - `POST /api/alert-thresholds/check` — Run threshold checks and send notifications (can be called by a scheduler)
- **Provider Abstraction:** Use your existing provider pattern to fetch inventory from SellerDynamics, Shopify, or others.

### Database/Storage
- Store alert threshold rules in your database (SQLite, Postgres, or a simple JSON file for MVP).

### Notification Service
- Use Nodemailer (for email) and Slack Webhooks (for Slack) in your API route.

---

## 3. Data Model Example (TypeScript)

```typescript
export interface AlertThreshold {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  status: 'Active' | 'Inactive';
  minStock: number;
  productIds: string[];
  emails: string[];
  frequency: 'daily' | 'weekly' | 'instant';
  time: string; // e.g., '18:00'
  timezone: string;
  filters?: Record<string, any>;
}
```

---

## 4. User Flow

1. Admin opens “Create Alert” wizard.
2. Step 1: Enter name, status, and select filters (e.g., “Track quantity”).
3. Step 2: Set threshold rule (e.g., “MIN_STOCK_THRESHOLD = 5”).
4. Step 3: Set frequency (scheduled/instant, time, timezone).
5. Step 4: Set notification (emails, Slack, template).
6. Preview: See which items are affected.
7. Save: Rule is stored in DB and appears in the AlertThresholdsList.

---

## 5. Scheduled/Automated Check

- Use a cron job (or Vercel/Netlify scheduled function, or a Next.js API route called by an external scheduler) to:
  - Fetch all active thresholds.
  - For each, fetch inventory via the provider abstraction.
  - If any item’s stock is below threshold, send notification.

---

## 6. Modern Tech Stack Features

- TypeScript everywhere (type safety for rules, API, and UI).
- React + MUI for a beautiful, accessible, and responsive UI.
- Next.js API routes for backend logic and notifications.
- Provider abstraction for flexible inventory source (SellerDynamics, Shopify, etc.).
- Email/Slack notifications using modern libraries (Nodemailer, Slack Webhooks).
- Unit/integration tests for API and UI logic (Jest, React Testing Library).

---

## 7. Extensibility

- Add more notification channels (SMS, Teams, etc.).
- Add more rule types (e.g., by location, by vendor).
- Add audit/history of alerts sent.

---

## 8. Example UI Flow (MUI Stepper)

- Step 1: Details & Filters
- Step 2: Rules
- Step 3: Frequency
- Step 4: Notification
- Step 5: Review & Save

---

## 9. Example API Route (Threshold Check)

```typescript
// pages/api/alert-thresholds/check.ts
import { getAllThresholds, sendNotification } from '...';
import { getInventoryProvider } from '...';

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const thresholds = await getAllThresholds();
  for (const threshold of thresholds) {
    const provider = getInventoryProvider();
    const inventory = await provider.getStockLevels({ ...threshold.filters });
    const lowStockItems = inventory.data.filter(item => item.Quantity <= threshold.minStock);
    if (lowStockItems.length > 0) {
      await sendNotification(threshold, lowStockItems);
    }
  }
  res.status(200).json({ success: true });
}
```

---

## 10. Next Steps

- [ ] Design the AlertThresholdsWizard component (multi-step, MUI Stepper)
- [ ] Implement backend API routes for CRUD and check
- [ ] Add notification logic (email/Slack)
- [ ] Integrate with provider abstraction for inventory
- [ ] Add scheduled job or endpoint for periodic checks
- [ ] Add tests
